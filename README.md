## Blind Accessibility Project

In an attemp to make blind people be able to play Yu-gi-oh online against sighted people, we forked [Project Ignis](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis): EDOPro and added a way to play the game using the keyboard only, besides adding support for screen readers.
Using a screen reader and your keyboard, you can navigate through the menus, edit your deck and even duel!
