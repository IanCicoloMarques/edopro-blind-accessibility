An attemp to make the game inclusive for blind people, a fork of the [Project Ignis](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis): EDOPro.

## Blind Accessibility Project

In an attemp to make blind people be able to play Yu-gi-oh online against sighted people, we forked [Project Ignis](https://github.com/ProjectIgnis): EDOPro and added a way for people to play using the keyboard only, besides adding support for screen readers.
Using a screen reader and your keyboard, you can navigate through the menus, edit your deck and even duel!

_Ignis_ is the fire and light of knowledge passed from the gods to humanity in Greco-Roman mythology.
This represents our vision for all of our projects and work and recognizes the contribution of every individual on the team.
